RTCP allows you to use virtual services published \r\nwith IBM Rational Integration Tester (RIT) to create, share, and deploy \r\nvirtualized test environments in IBM Rational Test Virtualization Server (RTVS).\r\n\r\nThe following diagram shows how RTCP might be deployed in a RTVS Environment.\r\n\r\n\r\n![RTCP](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/api/content/SSBLQQ_8.6.0/com.ibm.rational.rtcp.sysadmin.doc/images/RTCP_SYSADMIN_RTCP_RTVS-Environment.gif \"RTCP\")\r\n\r\n\r\nThis project contains ready-to-use examples that showcase features of RTCP and RIT.\r\n\r\n***\r\n## Download instructions\r\n\r\n- Go to GitHub project [https://github.com/ibm-rtvs/Examples](https://github.com/ibm-rtvs/Examples) and select *Download ZIP*\r\n- Unzip on a computer which has the following prerequisite software installed\r\n\t- Rational Integration Tester\r\n\t- Rational Integration Platform Pack\r\n\t- Rational Integration Tester Agent\r\n\t- Rational Test Control Panel \r\n\r\n\r\nAll examples assume that the prerequisite software was installed with the default options. Most notably\r\n- Software is at Version 6.0.1, or above\r\n- All software is installed on the same computer\r\n- Rational Test Control Panel port is 7189\r\n- HTTP proxy port is 3128\r\n  \r\n\r\n*** \r\n## Examples\r\n\r\n[*echo*](echo/README.md)\r\n\r\nThis example takes advantage of the **echo** example web service that is built into\r\nRTCP and includes: \r\n\r\n- A RIT project which contains a test to exercise the *echo* operation of the web service.\r\n\r\n[*calculator*](calculator/README.md)\r\n\r\nThis example takes advantage of the **calculator** example web service that is built into\r\nRTCP and includes:\r\n \r\n- A Java calculator application which uses the *calculator* web service to perform mathematical calculations.\r\nThough the application itself remains unchanged, it can be launched in one of two modes.\r\n\t- Normal mode where it connects directly to the web service\r\n\t- Test mode, where traffic is routed through through a RIT proxy. \r\n\tThis facilitates both tracing at the operational level and routing operations to the \r\n\tvirtual calculators (stubs) provided in the RIT project. \r\n\r\n- A RIT project which contains\r\n\t- A test suite which exercises basic calculator operations of the web service.\r\n    - Monitor definitions for all of the calculator operations\r\n\t- A stub which simulates all of the operations of the calculator web service\r\n    - A partial stub which lets most operations [pass-through](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSBLQQ_8.6.0/com.ibm.rational.rtvs.ref.doc/topics/c_rtvsref_sift_passthrough.html?lang=en \"sift-and-pass-through\") to the actual web service\r\n      but intercepts a specific operation to return an unexpected value\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
