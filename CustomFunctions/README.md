# Custom Functions Examples #

In IBM Rational Integration Tester (RIT) has the ability to specify (business) logic in it's tests and stubs. This can be done using the various Actions. For detailed handling you can leverage the Action Function. In this Action you can specify logic with the ECMAscript language. RIT provides several additional function which makes the scripts more readable and maintainable.
Due to the adhering of standards, leveraging Java, a user can implement his own Custom Functions.

This folder will have examples on various custom functions, furthermore it will also a separate project which showcases the power of these functions. That would 'bootstrap' new users.

**THIS IS VERY NEW AND UNDER HEAVY CONSTRUCTION. YOU CAN LITERALLY SEE THE GROWING OF THE PROJECT!**

The project started when customer demanded a specific function. This was first published at
http://business.vanlint5.nl . All functions and features are now documented over here.
